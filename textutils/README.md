# Project 1 - TextUtils

TextUtils is a simple React app built while learning ReactJS from the [CodeWithHarry React JS Playlist (Hindi)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agx66oZnT6IyhcMIbUMNMdt).

This repo documents my hands-on learning journey, including mistakes and fixes.

## Project Overview

TextUtils is a text utility app where users can:

- Convert text case
- Remove extra spaces
- Analyze word/character count
- Estimate reading time
- Use light/dark theme

- Fuction-based React components
- Props
- React hook `useState`
- Routing with `react-router-dom`

## Features Implemented

- Route-based pages (`/`, `/about`)
- Common layout with navbar across pages
- Theme toggle (light/dark)
- OS theme detection (`prefers-color-scheme`)
